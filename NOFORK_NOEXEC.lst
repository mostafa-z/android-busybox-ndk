Why an applet can't be NOFORK or NOEXEC?

Why can't be NOFORK:
interactive: may wait for user input, ^C has to work
spawner: "tool PROG ARGS" which changes program's environment - must fork
changes state: e.g. environment, signal handlers
runner: sometimes may run for long(ish) time, and/or works with network:
	^C has to work (cat BIGFILE, chmod -R, ftpget, nc)

"runners" can become eligible after hush is taught ^C to interrupt NOFORKs!

Why can't be NOEXEC:
suid: runs under different uid - must fork+exec

Why shouldn't be NOFORK/NOEXEC:
complex: no immediately obvious reason why NOFORK wouldn't work,
	but does some non-obvoius operations (example: fuser, lsof, losetup);
	nested xmallocs (typical in complex code) is a problem for NOFORK
rare: not used often enough to bother optimizing (example: poweroff)
longterm: often runs for a long time (many seconds), execing would make
	memory footprint smaller
daemon: runs indefinitely
